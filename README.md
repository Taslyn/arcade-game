# Arcade Game

This project contains everything you need to play a classic Arcade Game in your browser.
The goal of the game is to reach the water with your character. In order to do so, you have to avoid the bugs that cross the game board.

## 1. Explanation of the Project
The game board consists of three different areas: 
* the gras where the player can safely walk around
* the pavement where the enemy bugs walk around
* the water which is the player's goal

Furthermore, you have the player character and the enemy bugs.
The player character can move freely around the board. If he gets hit by a bug, he will be teleported back to the starting position on the gras. If he manages to reach the water, the same will happen. The enemy bugs move with different speeds, so stay alert if you want to reach the water!

## 2. How to install the game
To install a local copy of the game you can clone this GitHub repository. How to do this is explained [here](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/). Afterwards, just open the HTML File *index.html* in your browser and you can play!

## 3. Browser Compatibility

This project was designed to work on Google Chrome and was not tested on any other browsers. It was build using ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and will probably not work on browsers that do not support ES6. 
Since the layout of the game is not responsive, it is advised to play using a screen of sufficient size (a mobile phone will probably not work very well).
